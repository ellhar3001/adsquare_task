# adsquare_task

Good morning/afternoon

Firstly, I just wanted to say a quick thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on this assessment. I enjoyed the challenge and it has made me excited about continuing my application with Adsquare. 

This assessment was completed in a Jypter Notebook on Google Collab. I understand that this definitely was not the best or fastest way to complete this, however I am learned all my python skills in Jypter Notebooks so it was the medium that I felt most comfortable using, especially with the time sensitive nature of the task. 

The task.ipynb file should run without issue. 
1. Load all data
2. Convert to date time
3. Load Affinity Data (converted to csv as was unable to open in the format sent)
4. affinity checker - this did now work and would only load the sample series for each affinity. Due to the non-essential nature of this aspect I chose not to focus my time on fixing it
5. convert polygon/point data into relevant format
6. Checked each point in a polygon and then consolidates data into one dataframe

One problem that I encountered was the time that it took the run step 6. After i deemed that I have collated enough data to illustrate that I could attempt Task 2 I decided to stop running the sheet and save as a csv

The graph.ipynb should also run without issue. For this I used seaborn to plot graphs to visualise the data. 

The main insights that I drew are spiked in two Mcdonalds & Burger King's. However the number of unique visits is too small to establish whether this a definite trend or not. I believe if i was able to run the task.ipynb with the full data set then i would have been able to establish something more meaningful through my graph.ipynb document.

Tasks 3 and 4 were not completed. If I completing this task for work then I would have taken the csv produced in task.ipynb and run it in Tableau, where it is very easy to plot location data. Due to the wording on the task ('This clause is optional') I took it this was not an essential aspect to complete

Thank you for taking the time to read through this explanation. If you have any questions please reach out to me. Also any feedback would be greatly appreciated. 

Kind regards
